Trapping Rain Water
You are given an array non-negative integers height which represent an elevation map. Each value height[i] represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

Output: 9

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        leftMax = [0] * n
        rightMax = [0] * n
        
        leftMax[0] = height[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            leftMax[i] = max(leftMax[i - 1], height[i])
        
        rightMax[n - 1] = height[n - 1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            rightMax[i] = max(rightMax[i + 1], height[i])
        
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - height[i]
        return res
